# Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Getting Started with Image Processing

Welcome! This guide will help you start learning image processing step by step.

---

## Step 1: Understand Your Goal

You're building a **GDAL Image Processing App** using Streamlit. This app will:
- Process geospatial images
- Extract metadata and statistics
- Perform image operations
- Calculate spectral indices (like NDVI)
- Create visualizations

---

## Step 2: Start with Fundamentals

**Begin here:** `01_fundamentals/README.md`

**What you'll learn:**
- What digital images are
- How computers represent images
- Basic image properties

**Time:** 2-3 hours

**Action Items:**
1. Read the README
2. Complete the exercises
3. Try opening an image in Python
4. Calculate basic statistics

---

## Step 3: Learn GDAL Basics

**Next:** `02_gdal_basics/README.md`

**What you'll learn:**
- How to use GDAL
- Opening images with GDAL
- Reading band data
- Extracting metadata

**Time:** 3-4 hours

**Action Items:**
1. Read the README
2. Complete the exercises
3. Try opening a GeoTIFF with GDAL
4. Extract image properties

---

## Step 4: Continue Through Phases

Follow the phases in order:
1. ✅ Phase 1: Fundamentals
2. ✅ Phase 2: GDAL Basics
3. → Phase 3: Geospatial Concepts
4. → Phase 4: Image Operations
5. → Phase 5: Spectral Indices
6. → Phase 6: Visualization
7. → Phase 7: Advanced Topics

**Each phase builds on the previous one!**

---

## Step 5: Apply to Your App

As you learn each concept:
1. Understand it in the learning materials
2. Try it in code
3. See how it's used in `gdal_utils.py`
4. See how it appears in `streamlit_app.py`
5. Test it in the running app

**This reinforces learning!**

## Using QGIS to Learn

**Optional but Recommended:**

1. Install QGIS (see `QGIS_INTEGRATION.md`)
2. Use QGIS to visualize concepts
3. Understand operations visually
4. Implement same operations in Python

**This accelerates learning significantly!**

---

## Practice Exercises

Each phase has exercises. **Do them!**

**Why exercises matter:**
- Hands-on learning is most effective
- You'll remember what you practice
- Builds confidence
- Helps you understand the app code

---

## Getting Help

**If you're stuck:**
1. Re-read the relevant section
2. Look at the code in `gdal_utils.py`
3. Check the app to see it in action
4. Experiment with variations
5. Review previous phases

**Remember:** Learning is iterative. It's okay to not understand everything immediately!
