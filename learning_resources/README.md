## 🚀 How to Use This

### For Complete Beginners

1. **Start with:** `QUICK_START.md`
2. **Then read:** `LEARNING_PLAN.md` for the full trajectory
3. **Begin Phase 1:** Open `01_fundamentals/README.md`
4. **Follow phases in order:** Each builds on the previous
5. **Do the exercises:** Hands-on practice is essential
6. **Apply to your app:** See how concepts appear in the code

### Recommended Learning Path

```
Week 1-2: Fundamentals + GDAL Basics
  ↓
Week 3-4: Geospatial Concepts + Image Operations
  ↓
Week 5-6: Spectral Indices + Visualization
  ↓
Week 7-8: Advanced Topics + Final Project
```

### Time Commitment

- **Fast Track:** 4-6 weeks (10-15 hours/week)
- **Normal Pace:** 8 weeks (5-10 hours/week)
- **Slow Pace:** 12 weeks (3-5 hours/week)

## 📖 Learning Philosophy

### Learn by Doing
- Each phase has practical exercises
- Apply concepts immediately to your app
- Experiment and see what happens

### Build as You Learn
- Don't wait until you know everything
- Implement features as you learn them
- Your app grows with your knowledge

### Visual + Programmatic
- Use QGIS to visualize concepts (optional but recommended)
- Implement same operations in Python/GDAL
- Best of both worlds!

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this learning path, you will:

- ✅ Understand digital images and raster data
- ✅ Master GDAL for geospatial operations
- ✅ Perform image processing operations
- ✅ Calculate spectral indices (NDVI, etc.)
- ✅ Create visualizations and analyses
- ✅ Build a complete Streamlit application
- ✅ Handle geospatial metadata and projections

## 🔗 How This Relates to Your App

As you learn each concept, you'll see it in your app:

| Phase | App Feature |
|-------|-------------|
| Phase 1 | Overview tab (dimensions, bands) |
| Phase 2 | All tabs (GDAL powers everything) |
| Phase 3 | Geospatial tab (coordinates, bounds) |
| Phase 4 | Operations tab (format, normalization, colormap) |
| Phase 5 | Operations tab (NDVI calculation) |
| Phase 6 | Visualizations tab (all charts) |
| Phase 7 | Advanced tab (metadata, memory) |

**The app is your learning playground!**
