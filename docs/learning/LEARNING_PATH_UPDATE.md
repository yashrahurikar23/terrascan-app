## 🚀 Recommended Learning Path

### Option 1: Start with Pillow (Recommended) ⭐

```
Week 1-2: Fundamentals + Pillow Basics
  ↓
Week 2-3: GDAL Basics (when ready for geospatial)
  ↓
Week 3-4: Geospatial Concepts + Image Operations
  ↓
Week 5-6: Spectral Indices + Visualization
  ↓
Week 7-8: Advanced Topics + Final Project
```

**Why this path?**
- ✅ Easy to get started
- ✅ Learn concepts quickly
- ✅ Build confidence
- ✅ Add GDAL when needed

### Option 2: Direct to GDAL (Advanced)

```
Week 1-2: Fundamentals + GDAL Basics
  ↓
Week 3-4: Geospatial Concepts + Image Operations
  ↓
Week 5-6: Spectral Indices + Visualization
  ↓
Week 7-8: Advanced Topics + Final Project
```

**Why this path?**
- ✅ Full geospatial support from start
- ✅ Professional workflows
- ⚠️ More complex installation
